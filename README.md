# 🤖 Rock-Paper-Scissors Game with Hand Gesture Recognition ✋🖐️

Welcome to the **Rock-Paper-Scissors** game powered by **Hand Gesture Recognition**! 🎮 This fun and interactive game allows you to play **Rock-Paper-Scissors** against an AI, using your hand gestures for control! ✨

## 💡 About the Project

This project uses **OpenCV** and **HandTracking** to detect hand gestures and map them to the classic Rock-Paper-Scissors game moves. The AI plays randomly, and the game is played in real-time using your webcam! 🎥

- **Rock** 🪨: Represented by a closed fist (no fingers up)
- **Paper** 📄: Represented by an open hand (all fingers up)
- **Scissors** ✂️: Represented by two fingers (index and middle) extended

## 🎯 Features

- **Hand Gesture Detection**: The game detects your hand gestures using a webcam, so you don't need a mouse or keyboard! 👏
- **AI Opponent**: Face off against the AI, which randomly picks Rock, Paper, or Scissors! 🤖
- **Score Display**: Keep track of your score and the AI's score as the game progresses! 📊
- **Exciting Gameplay**: Play and have fun with the classic Rock-Paper-Scissors challenge! 🎉

## 🧠 How It Works

1. The game waits for you to show one of the hand gestures: Rock 🪨, Paper 📄, or Scissors ✂️.
2. The AI randomly selects a move.
3. The result of the round is shown with a score update: **Player** vs **AI**! 🏆
4. The game continues until you exit by pressing 'q' on your keyboard. ❌
